Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) Receipts include cases sent direct from magistrates' courts, bench warrants executed (trial and sentence only) and cases transferred in, less cases transferred out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Outstanding cases at end of period. The number of cases outstanding at the end of each period may not be equal to the sum of cases outstanding at the start of the period and those received during the period , minus cases completed. This is due to the timing of data extraction and counting rules applied to this data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) Includes committed for trials prior to the national abolition of committal hearings on 28th May 2013. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Sent for trial cases were introduced nationally for indictable only cases on the 15th January 2001 under section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.  Prior to this figures are from the pilot programme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Committal proceedings were abolished nationally on 28th May 2013. Triable-either-way cases are now sent rather than committed for trial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
