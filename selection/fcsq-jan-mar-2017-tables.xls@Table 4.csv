Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) These figures cover orders made only. Figures for other disposal types (Applications withdrawn, Orders refused and Orders of no order) are given in the CSV file that accompanies this publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The number of disposals shown in the table above are not equal to the corresponding number of applications made during the year, because:
     - disposals in one year may relate to applications made in earlier years; and,
     - an application for one type of order may result in another type of order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3) These orders refer to sections 33 and 34 of the Family Law Act 1986 and relate to children taken, or missing, from a parent or guardian granted a residence order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) These orders refer to section 50 of the Children Act 1989 and relate to children missing from care or emergency protection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) These orders relate to surrogacy and are made under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6) These figures include renewals of interim orders and it is likely that many individual children and cases are counted multiple times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
