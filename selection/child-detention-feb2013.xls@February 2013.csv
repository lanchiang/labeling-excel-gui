Background,,,,,,,,
The Home Office have released National Statistics on adults and children entering detention ,,,,,,,,
held solely under Immigration Act powers going back to Quarter 1 2009. They have been released ,,,,,,,,
"quarterly and are available in Immigration Statistics, on the Home Officeâ€™s Science, Research and",,,,,,,,
Statistics website at:,,,,,,,,
Migration statistics | Home Office,,,,,,,,
"The latest edition current to this release is Immigration Statistics: October - December 2012,",,,,,,,,
released on 28 February 2013. Statistics on people entering detention are shown in Tables dt.01 to dt.03.q.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"All the statistics on detention are released quarterly alongside other statistics related to migration, to",,,,,,,,
"allow a more coherent picture of immigration statistics, cover a wide range of data and avoid confusion ",,,,,,,,
"caused by frequent publications which may give conflicting messages. However, there has been a ",,,,,,,,
"recent increase in public and parliamentary interest in the numbers of children entering detention, held ",,,,,,,,
"solely under Immigration Act powers, as evidenced for example by a greater number of Parliamentary ",,,,,,,,
Questions and Freedom of Information Act requests on this subject. In order to service this latest ,,,,,,,,
interest and a desire for more frequent information it was decided to release monthly figures on children ,,,,,,,,
"entering detention, held solely under Immigration Act powers.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Notes on the table provided,,,,,,,,
Figures are likely to be revised in the subsequent Immigration Statistics release following individuals being ,,,,,,,,
age assessed as either adults or children. Therefore they should be seen as provisional and to be,,,,,,,,
superseded by the quarterly figures on children entering detention which will continue to be released,,,,,,,,
in Immigration Statistics.,,,,,,,,
"In order to make published figures as accessible as possible to a wide range of users, it is planned from ",,,,,,,,
25 April 2013 to publish future editions of this release in Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS) format ,,,,,,,,
"rather than Microsoft Excel. The aim is that users with most types of spreadsheet software, including Excel ",,,,,,,,
"and open source software, will be able to download and use the ODS format workbooks in the same way ",,,,,,,,
as currently or with better functionality. If you have any comments on these plans please contact us via,,,,,,,,
