1.  This is based on the schools statutory lowest and highest age of pupil. This is taken from Edubase and is given as at 11 September 2013. Only schools with eligible pupils are included in the figures.,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.  State-funded mainstream schools include academies, free schools and city technology colleges but exclude state-funded special schools, independent schools, independent special schools, non-maintained special schools, hospital schools, special academies and pupil referral units.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"3.  Level 4b is not included in the STA data but is derived from the test level and marks. A pupil with a mark in the top two thirds of the level 4 mark range or with level 5 or 6 is deemed to be at level 4b or above. It should be noted that these figures are not subject to the same statistical equating as the level thresholds to ensure that national standards are maintained. In addition, the level 4 mark range is not always an exact multiple of three. Changes over time at level 4b or above should therefore be interpreted with care. ",,,,,,,,,,,
4.  Pupils are expected to make at least two levels of progress between KS1 and KS2.,,,,,,,,,,,
