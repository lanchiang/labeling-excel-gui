"1. Number of offenders in each disposal category do not sum to the total number of offenders. This is due to a difference in methodology to provide a realistic and relevant view of proven reoffending by disposal type. The first event within each disposal is taken as the start point. Therefore, some offenders will appear in more than one disposal category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Court Orders include pre-Criminal Justice Act 2003 community sentences, new community orders and suspended sentence orders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. As Court Order figures include pre-Criminal Justice Act 2003 community sentences, they will not equal the sum of Community Order and Suspended Sentence Order figures. Community Orders and Suspended Sentence Orders were introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and came into force from April 2005",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
