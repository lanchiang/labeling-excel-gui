(1) Due to the introduction of a new prison IT system the 2010 prison population data is now taken from a different source and recalls are shown separately (they were previously included in the relevant sentence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
length band). The 2009 figures from both the old and new systems have been presented to aid comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2)Sentence length is not recorded centrally for a small proportion of prisoners. For these cases we have estimated the broad sentence length band, but they cannot be allocated to a more detailed sentence length band",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Prior to 2010 recalls were not recorded separately but were counted in the relevant sentence band,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
