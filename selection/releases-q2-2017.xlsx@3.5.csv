(1) Sentence type is based on the prisonerâ€™s custody type at the point of their first ROTL of the quarter.,,,,,,
"(2) One individual may be released on temporary licence in more than one quarter of the year. Users should therefore not sum four quarters worth of data for the annual number of prisoners released on temporary licence. Annual figures are provided in the annual releases tables, typically published in April of each year.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
(3) The other sentence type category includes fine defaulters and non-criminal prisoners.,,,,,,
"(4) Not all temporary release failures are recorded on central administrative systems. Those that are not recorded centrally are more likely to be low-level failures including, for example, returning with unauthorised possessions and failing alcohol meter.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"(r) Historical figures have been revised following a reconciliation exercise of temporary release failure data. Previous figures were based on data from different sources extracted at different times. While figures at the time of publication reflected the data extracted, further incidents and details may have been added since. Previous data from the various sources have been amalgamated and cleansed to form the main source of temporary release failure data.",,,,,,

,,,,,,
(r) Incidences of release on temporary licence figures for Q1 2017 have been revised after 5 incidences of ROTL from Medway were incorrectly included.,,,,,,
