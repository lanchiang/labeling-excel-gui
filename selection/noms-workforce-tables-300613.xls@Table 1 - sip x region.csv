Notes to Table 1:,,,,,,,,,,
1.,Information reflects the latest regional management structure which is not the structure in place throughout the time series,,,,,,,,,
2.,In June 2010 approximately 1500 NOMS HQ staff transferred to the central Ministry of Justice,,,,,,,,,
3.,"On 1 October 2011, the management of HMP Birmingham was transferred to the private sector and therefore were removed from these figures.",,,,,,,,,
4.,Four establishments outside of the London Boroughs are managed by the London DDC and are therefore included within the Greater London region.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,"All figures are rounded to the nearest 10. As with all HR databases, extracts are taken at a fixed point in time, to ensure consistency of reporting. However the database itself is dynamic, and where updates to the database are made late, subsequent to the taking of the extract, these updates will not be reflected in figures produced by the extract. For this reason, HR data are unlikely to be precisely accurate, and to present unrounded figures would be to overstate the accuracy of the figures. Rounding to 10 accurately depicts the level of certainty that is held with these figures.",,,,,,,,,
,"Totals are formed from unrounded parts prior to rounding. For this reason, rounded totals may not equal the sum of their rounded parts.",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,"~ denotes suppressed values of 5 or fewer. Low numbers are suppressed, in conjunction with the rounding policy to prevent disclosure in accordance with the Data Protection Act, 1998.",,,,,,,,,
