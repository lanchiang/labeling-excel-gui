(1) Figures include incidents at HMPPS operated Immigration Removal Centres.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Figures do not include incidents at Medway STC. For more information on Secure Training Centres, please see Youth justice annual statistics at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/youth-justice-annual-statistics",,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) In prisons, as in the community, it is not possible to count self-harm incidents with absolute accuracy. In prison custody, however, such incidents are more likely to be detected and counted. Care needs to be taken when comparing figures shown here with other sources where data may be less complete. ",,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Numbers of individuals should be treated as approximate, as the details of prisoners are not always recorded against each self-harm incident.",,,,,,,,,,,
