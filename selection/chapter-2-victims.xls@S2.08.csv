1. Estimates may be biased due to the skewed frequency distribution of the dependent variable; 97.0% of respondents had not been a victim of violence in the 12 months prior to interview.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Where variables or categories are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (p<0.05) values are highlighted in bold. Categories in italics are those which were used as reference categories.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Odds ratios of greater than one indicate relatively higher odds compared with the reference category in that variable; less than one indicates relatively lower odds. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. The unweighted base includes all respondents resident in households in England and Wales who gave a valid response to all questions included in the model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. The Nagelkerke R square indicates which model has the highest model fit. The higher the value the better the model predicts the outcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. The -2 log-likelihood (-2LL) is a measure implying what remains unexplained by the model. If the -2LL difference exceeds a critical value that model explains the dependent variable significantly better than the model from the previous iteration (indicated by *,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
