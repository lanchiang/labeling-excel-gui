Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) A case is counted as disposed when all offences on a case have a final outcome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) Outstanding Cases is a snapshot of live cases on the system, where the case receipt is after October 2007. The count of outstanding cases can be influenced by the transfering of a case, change to offences or where cases or offences are subsequently entered in error. It is not a calculation based on receipts and disposals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3) Data may change when re-freshed following a data validation process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4) Data are currently only available from April 2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5) Includes committed for trial cases prior to the national abolition of committal hearings on 28th May 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6) Committal proceedings were abolished nationally on 28th May 2013. Triable-either-way cases are now sent rather than committed for trial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
