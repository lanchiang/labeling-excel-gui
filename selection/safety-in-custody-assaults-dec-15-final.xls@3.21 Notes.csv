3.21. Notes on Data and Methodology
""
""
1) Revisions: reported assaults are kept under review and may be revised if new information emerges
2) Prison population: figures are averaged across 12 months. See MOJ's Offender Management annual statistics Table A1.2.
"3) Data Sources and Quality: these figures have been drawn from administrative IT systems.  Care is taken when processing and analysing returns but the detail is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. Although shown to the last case, the figures may not be accurate to that level."
"4) Counting assaults: Prison violence can be measured in a number of ways.  This report focuses on assault incidents including fights.  A new Key Performance Indicator for serious assaults was introduced in 2003/04 and as a result reporting of all assault incidents improved. Reported incidents before 2005 are therefore not directly comparable with later figures. In particular, although figures for 2000 and 2002 have been included they are under reported by modern standards.  It is now expected that all assaults, including fights, should be reported whether or not there was an injury.  As this was not the case in the past care needs to be taken when interpreting changes over the years."
"5) In prisons, as in the community, it is not possible to count assault incidents with absolute accuracy. In prison custody, however, such incidents are more likely to be detected and counted. Care needs to be taken when comparing figures shown here with other sources where data may be less complete. "
"6) Prisoner involvement in assaults: Prisoners may be involved in assault incidents in a number of ways e.g. helping staff, were present at scene etc. These tables only consider the three main roles of those most directly involved: assailant, fighter and victim."
7) Prisoner details: The NOMS incident reporting system only records the details of prisoners known to have been involved in a particular incident.  
8) Gender: refers to the gender of the prisoners involved and not of any staff or non prisoners such as visitors who may be involved.
9) Age: the unknown age category used here refers to identified prisoners whose ages were not recorded on the system at the time of the incident.  They can arise when new prisoners are being escorted to prison for the first time and there has been insufficient time to enter all of the prisoner's details  The circumstances are such that fights with other prisoners or being a victim of an assault by another prisoner is less likely. The unknown age category does NOT refer to unknown assailants.
      Age group classifications for assault incidents on staff is determined by the age of the prisoners involved.  If this is not stated the incident is classified based on the type of establishment where the incident took place. Occasionally this will misclassify the assailant's age e.g. a member of staff working in a YOI assaulted by an adult visitor. In a small number of assaults on staff the age group was unknown. They relate to incidents in mixed role prisons (either Juvenile/YO or YO/Adult) and where no prisoner involvements were recorded.
"10) Time in current prison: This is defined as the number of elapsed days between the date of arrival in current prison and date of incident. '3 months' is defined as 90 days, '3 to 6 months' is defined as 91 to 182 days.  "
11) Race: based on self reporting by prisoners and has not been independently validated. It is based on recorded ethnicity within the prison administrative system. The mixed race category was introduced in 2003. In earlier years most prisoner in this category would have been in the 'other' category. Care needs to be taken when comparing race splits after 2003 with earlier figures.    
12) Sexual assaults: sexual assault incidents account for less than 2% of all assault incidents. Determination of whether a particular assault should be classified as sexual is guided by the wishes of the victim. A small proportion of those reported here will refer to incidents that occurred outside prison custody and some will be unproven allegations.
"13) Weapons: The majority of assault incidents do not involve weapons; those that do mostly involve items that may be found to hand. Relatively few involve a purpose-designed weapon.
Although more than one weapon may be used in a particular incident, the figures in this table show only the most serious weapon type in each incident.       
The 'other' weapon category contains a wide range of items that can be found to hand but cannot easily be classified as one of the other categories. Biting is commonly recorded in the 'other' category and is shown separately."
14) Injuries: the classification of injuries is based on initial assessment by prison staff and should not be treated as confirmed clinical diagnoses. 
      In-patient hospital attendances refer to those arising immediately from assault incidents.  They do NOT include other types of hospital attendance such as A&E or overnight visits nor do they include any subsequent hospital visits that may be required to continue treatment.
