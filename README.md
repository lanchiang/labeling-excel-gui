# Verbose CSV File Annotation Tool
This project provides a user-friendly GUI to allow annotating 1) line classes; 2) cell classes; 3) aggregations of verbose CSV files.

Todo-list:
* Cell class annotation
  * SheetDisplayTableModel implementation is not perfect.
  * Copy and paste pattern would both need a shortcut.
  * Maybe there is a need to add a new line class.
  * When the file is loaded, also load the already annotated files.
    
* Aggregation annotation
  * Percentage calculation function has bugs.
  * Add support for multi-aggregator view mode
  * Add suport for free mode annotation
