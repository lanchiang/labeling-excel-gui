# labeling-excel-gui
This project implements a java gui interface to allow labeling excel file line functions

Todo-list:
* SheetDisplayTableModel implementation is not perfect.
* add a table to display the name of annotated tables, selecting a piece of the table should allow to recap its annotation.
