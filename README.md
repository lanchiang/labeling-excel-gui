# labeling-excel-gui
This project implements a java gui interface to allow labeling excel file line functions

Todo-list:
* SheetDisplayTableModel implementation is not perfect.
* Copy and paste pattern would both need a shortcut.
* Maybe there is a need to add a new line class.
* When the file is loaded, also load the already annotated files.
